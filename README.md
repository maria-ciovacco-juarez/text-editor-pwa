# text-editor-pwa
Challenge 19

##Description

With this challenge I lunched a text editor called JATE that is deloyed through Heroku. This application can work online as well as locally. 

## Usage

Click the deployed link to access online --> https://edits-on-edits.herokuapp.com/

It will look like this:

You can type whatever text you want and click away from the DOM to make it save. Click refresh to see it's still there. Not clicking away from the DOM will not save any changes, so if you click refresh without doing so, it'll all go away.

Watch this video for a proper demonstration on usage as well as installation --> https://watch.screencastify.com/v/h5H26CskN3X1Tpfr7gSz

## How to Clone

To access locally, clone this code via your Terminal (MacOS) or git bash (Windows). "cd" into the newly created folder and type "code ." then hit enter. Your coding software of choice should automatically open. I recommend VS Code if you don't have one. 

In VS Code you can open the integrated terminal and type "npm start" to start the server. 

You'll know it's working when it says "Now listening on port: localhost:3000"

Copy and paste "localhost:3000" into the address bar of any broswer of your choice.

Hit "enter" or "return" and the editor will prompt right up.

Use Ctrl+C to kill the server in the integrated terminal when you're done.
